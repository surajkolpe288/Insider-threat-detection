The project entitled “Insider threat detection using supervised machine learning” is a group project done by four members including myself in our 6th semester of our B. tech degree. 

 Insider threats present a grave concern for organizations as individuals with authorized access can exploit privileges for malicious intent. Detecting such threats is challenging due 
 to their familiarity with systems and evasion tactics. This study introduces a supervised machine learning method for detection, leveraging diverse data sources like user logs and network traffic. 
 Features like login frequency and anomalies form the basis for training the model to distinguish normal behaviour from threats. Evaluation on historical data shows the model's accuracy in identifying 
 threats while minimizing false alarms, outperforming existing methods. This underscores the value of supervised machine learning in bolstering proactive threat detection alongside traditional security measures. 
 By harnessing advanced analytics and pattern recognition, organizations can better safeguard critical assets, ensuring operational integrity is maintained. 

 So techically, the implementation of this detection software is done completely using python programming language. In this program we have used different python libraries like pandas, scikit -learn, matplotlib 
 or seaborn. In this software we have used a dataset to train our ml model so that it helps in detection of threat. The dataset that we have used is prepared using various ai tools. Each library mentioned above has
 its own specification which contributes in overall working of the software. 

 The functionality of each python library is as follows: 
 
   1. Pandas : This library is used for reading the data from the dataset, so that further operations can be performed on it.
   2. Scikit-learn : This python library is used for feature extration from the dataset(Manual_dataset.csv).
   3. Mathplotlib or seaborn : This python library just for pictorial representation of the values gained. As the output of this software are numerical 
                               values (i.e. Accuracy percentage, Precision, f1 score) this python library helps in better understanding.
