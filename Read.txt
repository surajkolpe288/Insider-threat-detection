The project entitled “Insider threat detection using supervised machine learning” is a group project done by four members including myself in our 6th semester of our B. tech degree. 
 Insider threats present a grave concern for organizations as individuals with authorized access can exploit privileges for malicious intent. Detecting such threats is challenging due to their familiarity with systems and evasion tactics. This study introduces a supervised machine learning method for detection, leveraging diverse data sources like user logs and network traffic. Features like login frequency and anomalies form the basis for training the model to distinguish normal behaviour from threats. Evaluation on historical data shows the model's accuracy in identifying threats while minimizing false alarms, outperforming existing methods. This underscores the value of supervised machine learning in bolstering proactive threat detection alongside traditional security measures. By harnessing advanced analytics and pattern recognition, organizations can better safeguard critical assets, ensuring operational integrity is maintained
